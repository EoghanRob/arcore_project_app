# arcore_project_app

Flutter project created for a technical interview with Aegis Rider.

## Description

Augmented reality phone app that allows the user to configure a HUD.

Tested on an Android phone.

## Issues
Warning about XML SDK, but app builds anyway.

Kotlin errors when compiling (one of the plug-ins seems to require a different version of Kotlin to what I was using), but app builds anyway.
